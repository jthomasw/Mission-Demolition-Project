 Mission Demolition

This isn't your average Mission Demolition project. This is Mission Demolition Nuclear (patent pending). 
Additional Cool Stuff-
Nukes
Explosion SFX (HEADPHONE WARNING)
Crazy Wacky Structures

Difficulty- 
This game is really hard with the basic ball.
I recommend going nuclear if stuck.
The last level is only easy if you go nuclear, 
I recommend sticking to the normal balls on it.

Nuclear Mode- 
Pressing the nuclear button (next to switch view) will make you go nuclear

Nukes-
glitch out structures sometimes completely removing them.
They are red instead of the default grey

Immovable Objects- 
You might encounter black obsidian walls that don't move 
these can be tricky but are made to really balance out the nuke

Thank you for playing :)
